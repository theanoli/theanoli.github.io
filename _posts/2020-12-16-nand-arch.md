## Multi-level cells
A flash cell stores individual bits. 
xLC describes the number of bits that can be stored in a flash cell: 

* SLC: 1
* MLC: 2
* TLC: 3
* QLC: 4

The cell stores multiple bits by increasing the number of states it represents. 
An MLC flash cell, for example, needs to represent four different states (00, 01, 10, 11). 
Since a flash cell's state is determined by the amount of charge it holds, representing more states means it must be more precisely programmable (i.e., its tolerances are smaller), since the gaps between states are smaller[^cactus-xlc]. 

## Strings on up
These are composed into *strings*, or 32-64 cells attached end-to-end with a source at one end and a sink at the other[^cactus-string]. 
NAND strings are connected by way of their sources to form NAND flash arrays. 
Strings are additionally connected via their control gates; that is, the 0th control gates in an array of NAND strings are connected, as are the 1st, 2nd, ..., *n*th. 

For visualization purposes the strings are laid out vertically, while the source line and the gate-to-gate lines are horizontal. 
Strings (columns) are the minimum read unit; *pages* (rows) are the minimum program unit[^cactus-pages]. 
*Blocks* (columns + rows) are the minimum erase unit. 
This is because all of the strings in a block are connected to the same source, and blocks are erased by adding charge to flash cells. 

The next architectural unit up is the *plane*, consisting of a bunch of blocks, and these are put together to form a *die*. 
Finally, multiple *dies* can be on the same *channel*, and channels are connected to the device's controller that can issue operations to all channels in parallel. 
Controllers on higher-end devices use PCIe to interface with the host; lower-end devices use SATA. 

## A little more about planes
Planes on the same die share a register. 
The register is used to transfer data page-wise from one plane to another without involvement from the flash controller for data transfer (the controller still has to tell the planes what to move where)[^ttflash].
