I'm a PhD student in Computer Science. I work on distributed systems, in particular on large-scale storage systems.

This blog is a place for me to practice writing and to refresh my knowledge of basic computer science concepts that come up as I read papers, news articles, or product releases. I may occasionally write about other topics (baking, cats).
