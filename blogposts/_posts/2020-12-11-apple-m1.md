### The M1 System-on-Chip
Apple's M1[^1] is a system on a chip (SoC). A SoC has all the components you'd normally put in a computer---CPU, networking hardware, memory, etc. on the same chip. 
Smartphones, IoT devices, and embedded systems use SoCs. 

The M1 is manufactured by Apple for its laptops. 
It uses the same A14 CPU as the SoC in the iPhone[^6]; the A14 uses the ARM ISA. 
This is a pretty significant change; Apple laptops used to use Intel x86-based chips. 
[Here](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16226/apple-silicon-m1-a14-deep-dive) is a neat annotated image of the SoC showing all the known parts and all the (sizeable) chip area whose purpose is apparently a secret. 

### ARM and x86
ARM[^5] and x86[^4] are instruction set architectures. 
ARM is owned by Arm Holdings; anyone who wants to manufacture a CPU with the ARM ISA must buy a license (or core design) from Arm Holdings. 
Meanwhile, x86 has been around for long enough that it can't be patented in its entirety anymore. 
Intel and AMD hold patents on "some advanced features" of the architecture[^4], and both also manufacture chips. 

ARM is a RISC ("reduced instruction set computing") architecture. RISC requires fewer transistors so it's cheaper, consumes less power, and dissipates heat better than CISC CPUs. 
This is why it's currently used primarily in mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.)

x86 is a CISC ("complex instruction set computing") architecture---the difference between RISC and CISC is like the difference between an operation and a transaction, in that RISC instructions execute single low-level operations whereas CISC instructions may execute more than one low-level operation. 

## Some terms
* **Wintel**: **Win**dows machine running on In**tel** or AMD x86 processors.[^1]

* **OEM**: [Original Equipment Manufacturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer), e.g., Foxconn, that produces equipment other companies can use in their own products (e.g., Dell, HP, Nintendo). 
Companies (e.g., HP, Compaq, IBM) used to manufacture their own equipment, but this went out of style in part because "using an OEM also allows the purchasing company to obtain needed components or products without owning and operating a factory."[^3]
