Wintel: **Win**dows machine running on In**tel** or AMD x86 processors.[1]

OEM = [Original Equipment Manufacturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer), e.g., Foxconn, that produces equipment other companies can use in their own products (e.g., Dell, HP, Nintendo). 
Companies (e.g., HP, Compaq, IBM) used to manufacture their own equipment, but this went out of style in part because "using an OEM also allows the purchasing company to obtain needed components or products without owning and operating a factory."[2]
Designing and fabricating CPUs is hard, as well, and having someone else do it---namely, x86---meant less headache for these companies. 

### ARM and x86
ARM[4] and x86[3] are instruction set architectures. 
ARM is owned by Arm Holdings; anyone who wants to manufacture a CPU with the ARM ISA must buy a license (or core design) from Arm Holdings. 
Meanwhile, x86 has been around for long enough that it can't be patented in its entirety anymore. 
Intel and AMD hold patents on "some advanced features" of the architecture[3], and both also manufacture chips. 

AMD is RISC: "reduced instruction set computing", requires fewer transistors so it's cheaper, consumes less power, dissipates heat better than CISC. Currently used primarily in mobile devices (laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc.)
x86 is CISC: "complex instruction set computing"---the difference between RISC and CISC is like the difference between an operation and a transaction, in that RISC instructions execute single low-level operations whereas CISC instructions may execute more than one low-level operation. 

### The M1 chip
M1 is a SoC. 
Manufactured by Apple
ARM ISA (same A14 CPU as in the iPhone)[5]; Apple laptops used to use x86 CPUs
